# Team deliverables
Throughout the semester you will be required to submit team deliverables. In order to keep everyone's work safe and easy for me to find, all work must be submitted to me by adding it to your team deliverable repo.

Please keep this repo tidy and well-organised. If I can't find your team's work in under two minutes, I will consider it missing.
